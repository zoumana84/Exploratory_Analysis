```{R}

LasVegas = read.csv("LasVegasTripAdvisorReviews-Dataset.csv",  stringsAsFactors=TRUE, sep = ";")
LasVegas
attach(LasVegas)


```


 
 1. Exploring the structure of the data set, we can see that the data frame has 20 variables of 504 observations. 6 of the variables are numeric, the rest are categorical.

```{R}
str(LasVegas)
summary(LasVegas)

```
 
 2. Does any of the variables have missing values? There are no variables with missing values. The summary of the LasVegas variable also confirms that no variables have missing values
```{R}
sum(is.na(LasVegas))

```

3. Draw a histogram of the score variable. The histogram shows the majority of scores are 3.5 and higher
```{R}
hist(Score, main = "Histogram of user Scores", xlab= "Score")

```

4. Find the mode of Score. The mode is 5.

```{R}
t = table(Score)
t[t == max(t)]
names(t[t == max(t)])

```

5. The quantile of scores. According to the quantile of Score, the median is 4.

```{R}
quantile(Score)


```

6. Sentiment variable:

```{R}

sentiment = factor(c(ifelse( Score >= 4, "positive", "negative")))
summary(sentiment)

```

7. Based on the chi-square statistical analysis, it can be concluded that the variables related to sentiment are: Pool, Free internet, hotel stars.

```{R}
install.packages("gmodels")
library(gmodels)
CrossTable(x = sentiment, y = Pool,chisq = TRUE)
CrossTable(x = sentiment, y = Gym,chisq = TRUE)
CrossTable(x = sentiment, y = Free.internet,chisq = TRUE)
CrossTable(x = sentiment, y = Period.of.stay,chisq = TRUE)
CrossTable(x = sentiment, y = Traveler.type,chisq = TRUE)
CrossTable(x = sentiment, y = Hotel.stars,chisq = TRUE)
model1 = oneway.test(Hotel.stars ~ Member.years, data = LasVegas)
summary(model1)
